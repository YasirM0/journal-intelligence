"""
Application-level search service.

This is the seam between the UI (Streamlit) and the core recommendation
engine. Streamlit pages should call into this module rather than
constructing a JournalRecommender or touching the repository directly —
that keeps the recommendation engine and database access fully
independent of Streamlit, so they can be reused by another frontend
(a script, a different UI, a desktop wrapper) without changes.

Nothing in this module imports streamlit.
