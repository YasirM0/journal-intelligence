# Database: schema, import pipeline, and merge strategy

## Schema

**`journals`** — one row per real-world journal, regardless of how many
indexes it appears in. Core metadata (title, publisher, country, ISSNs,
subjects, APC, license, review time, ...) comes from whichever source
had the richest data for that journal — in practice, DOAJ first, then
Scopus/SINTA metadata is used to fill in journals DOAJ doesn't have.

**`journal_sources`** — one row per (journal, source) pair. This is what
makes the model source-agnostic: a journal with rows for `DOAJ`,
`Scopus`, and `Web of Science` is still ONE row in `journals`, tagged
three times here. Source-specific metadata that doesn't apply to every
source lives here too (`quartile`, `sjr`, `h_index` for Scopus/WoS;
`accreditation` for SINTA) and is simply NULL where it doesn't apply.

Indexes exist on `issn_print`, `issn_online`, `title`, `country`
(journals) and `journal_id`, `source` (journal_sources) for query speed.

## Supported collections (v0.1.x)

| Source | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| DOAJ | `data/raw/doaj.csv` | Base catalog — richest per-journal metadata |
| Scopus | `data/raw/scimagojr.csv` | Tags + quartile/SJR/H-index, via SCImago |
| Web of Science | `data/raw/wos.csv` | Tags + quartile/SJR/H-index — the SAME SCImago format, pre-filtered by the maintainer to WoS-indexed journals only |
| SINTA | `data/raw/sinta.csv` | Tags + accreditation tier (SINTA 1–6) |

Not yet supported: Google Scholar (no bulk export exists to import from
— there's nothing to build a real filter against), OpenAlex, Crossref,
Sherpa Romeo. Adding a new source means writing one importer following
the same pattern as `importers/scimago.py` or `importers/sinta.py`, not
changing the schema.

## Import pipeline

Run `python3 scripts/build_database.py` from the project root. This is
a **full rebuild**: it drops and recreates `journals` and
`journal_sources`, then imports all four sources in order (DOAJ →
Scopus → Web of Science → SINTA). To refresh any dataset, replace the
matching file in `data/raw/` (same filename) and re-run the script —
no code changes needed for a routine data update.

## Deduplication / merge strategy

For each incoming row (Scopus, WoS, SINTA):

1. Try to match an existing journal by ISSN (print or online).
2. If no ISSN match, try an **exact** normalized-title match (lowercased,
   punctuation stripped, whitespace collapsed).
3. If neither matches, a new `journals` row is created from that
   source's own metadata, tagged only with that source.

This is not fuzzy matching. Two records for the same journal with a
meaningfully different title (e.g. one includes a subtitle the other
doesn't, or a transliteration differs) will NOT be merged and will end
up as two separate rows. `scripts/build_database.py` prints how many
matches were made by ISSN vs. by title as a rough signal — a high
title-only match count is worth spot-checking by hand.

### What actually happened on the last real build

From `data/raw/doaj.csv` (23,077), `scimagojr.csv` (32,193 Scopus
rows), `wos.csv` (17,815 WoS rows — a subset of the Scopus file), and
`sinta.csv` (15,453 rows):

- DOAJ: 23,077 journals (base catalog)
- Scopus: 9,194 matched an existing DOAJ journal; 22,999 had no DOAJ
  match and became new journal rows (expected — DOAJ is open-access
  only, Scopus is much broader)
- Web of Science: all 17,815 rows matched something already in the
  database (0 new) — expected, since this file is a subset of the
  Scopus file already imported; this is a useful sanity check that the
  matching logic is working
- SINTA: 5,989 matched; 9,464 became new rows (mostly lower-tier
  Indonesian journals not indexed elsewhere)
- **Total: 55,540 unique journals**

## Attribution

- **DOAJ**: journal-level metadata (the CSV this project imports) is
  released under a **CC0 waiver** — no attribution is legally required
  — per DOAJ's own terms: https://www.doaj.org/terms/. Crediting it is
  still good practice and is shown in the app regardless.
- **Scopus / Web of Science data (via SCImago)**: SCImago's own site
  states their data may be used for non-commercial purposes **as long
  as it is cited**: "SCImago, (n.d.). SJR — SCImago Journal & Country
  Rank [Portal]. Retrieved from https://www.scimagojr.com". This is a
  real requirement, not a courtesy — keep the citation wherever this
  data is shown or redistributed, and keep usage non-commercial.
- **SINTA**: no official bulk-export terms exist; this dataset is a
  maintainer-run scrape of https://sinta.kemdikbud.go.id/journals, not
  an official SINTA download. Worth keeping in mind if this project (or
  its database) is ever shared outside your own use.

The Streamlit search page shows a data-source credit line at the bottom
of every results view.

## Architecture note

`services/recommender.py` and `services/repository.py` do not import
Streamlit and can be used from a script or another frontend.
`services/search_service.py` is the intended entry point for any UI —
Streamlit pages should call it instead of touching the recommender or
repository directly. This is a first pass at that separation, scoped to
what the search page needed; other pages haven't been touched yet.
